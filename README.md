## Project Overview

**Authentication System** is a comprehensive and secure solution designed to streamline user management, authentication, and authorization for web applications. Addressing the common challenges of implementing robust security measures, this system integrates multiple authentication methods, including OAuth and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), to enhance both security and user experience. Whether you're building a small project or a large-scale application, our system offers flexibility and scalability to meet your needs.

## Features

- **User Authentication:**
  - **Email and Password Login:** Secure login system using traditional email and password credentials.
  - **OAuth Integration with Google and GitHub:** Allow users to authenticate using their existing Google or GitHub accounts for convenience and enhanced security.
  - **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification via email or authenticator apps.

- **User Management:**
  - **User Registration and Profile Management:** Enables users to create accounts and manage their personal information.
  - **Email Verification and Password Reset:** Ensures account security by verifying user emails and providing secure password recovery options.
  - **Admin Dashboard:** A centralized interface for administrators to manage users and oversee content effectively.

- **Advanced Features:**
  - **Responsive and Reusable UI Components:** Provides a consistent and adaptable user interface across different devices.
  - **Middleware for Session Handling and Route Protection:** Secures application routes and manages user sessions seamlessly.
  - **Backend Integration with Prisma and a Relational Database:** Utilizes Prisma for efficient database interactions and management.

- **Deployment:**
  - **Ready for Deployment on Platforms like Vercel, AWS, or Netlify:** Simplifies the deployment process across popular cloud platforms.
  - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipelines:** Automates testing and deployment to ensure rapid and reliable updates.
